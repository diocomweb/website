The Diode Foundation structures its ecosystem efforts around regional groups, each led by one or more regional leaders. 

# Forming a Regional Group

If you are interested in forming a Regional Group, please reach out to us via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qdGCAKJdHs) in the in the [Diode Community Zone](https://diode.io/joinzone/#1MQKGI_TUYpNksoAAK6TSynBPpviy5MPgDRyTiO7YuGh5_H5sHDN9VIB1diC).

A large country or provice may have multiple regional groups.

# Becoming a Regional Leader

We've found the best Regional Leaders typically go through these steps:

1. Already have a passion for secure, private, and unblockable communications and decentralized technologies
2. Join the Discord or Diode Community Zone and begin contributing to the discussion
3. Sign up for the [Diode Referral Program](/docs/programs/ambassador_registration_program.html) and refer others and bring active Nodes and/or Zones online
4. Propose creating a Regional Group with ideas around growth and goals
5. Lead the growth of active Nodes, Zones, content, and group members

# Benefits to being a Regional Leader

Regional leaders are invited to join Diode's Regional Leaders private chat where news and opportunities are presented first.  They and their groups will often have first mover advantage for new programs, incentives, and initiatives based on the information provided there.

Regional Leaders who have demonstrated their ability to lead the growth of Nodes, Zones, content, and regional members will have their referral code listed prominently as the regional "Seed" referral code.

Other resources can be made available to Regional Leaders to assist with growing the community and enabling them to contribute effectively to the ecosystem.
   
# Core Activities

More information on these core activities are below:
** 1 - Grow Active Relay Nodes**
** 2 - Grow Active Members**
** 3 - Support Your Group!**

After a regional leader is chosen for a group, the team will book a kickoff call to set goals for these activites.

## 1) Grow Active Relay Nodes

Each region should grow a regional network of relay nodes dispersed to service local devices and users. 

The Diode Network is a decentralized mesh of these relay nodes.  In aggregate, the nodes create a layer of infrastructure that power the apps and solutions built on top of the network.

The deployment goals vary per region based on population, infrastructure, and regional bandwidth demand. Every relay node creates a local hub of communication, increasing the speed and strengthening the security of devices and users communicating in its vicinity.

Every active Relay Node gets rewards, and each person in the "Referral Hierarchy" that referred the Node runner also receives rewards.

## 2) Grow Active Members

Each regional group will have a Diode Collab Zone for group coordination, communication, and collaboration.

The regional leader should maintain the zone for their region. Although other forms of communication can also be used, an important activity is to use the Zone to encourage the members to embrace and promote privacy, security, and world-wide access via the Diode technologies.

Every active Regional Collaboration Zone gets rewards, and each person in the "Referral Hierarchy" that referred the Zone runner also receives rewards.

## 3) Support Your Group!

If Diode Collab does not yet support the local language, a key regional activity is contributing to a crowd-sourced translation for the app.

Additionally, a strong regional team culture can be built by providing support for Diode technologies and updates about Diode, Web3, and Privacy topics in the local language.

Regional leaders are not expected to have a technical background, and can translate/forward the message to Diode team or other of their more technical regional team members to assist with questions.

# Additional Activites

## Events

Regional leaders are encouraged to go to regional exhibitions and congresses to promote Diode and bring more users and builders. Although there's a preference for DePin- or Web3-related events, other Web2 and privacy-related events might be suitable. If there are group members nearbye, regional leaders can also promote gathering events.

## Universities & Workshops

Universities and workshops are a great way to bring more relay nodes and builders online. Regional leaders should work to cultivate group members who can help introduce Diode to relevant local university programs.

## Enterprise/B2B Adoption And Sales Affiliates

Diode Collab and the Diode Network is in use by several enterprises that prioritize secure and private communication and connectivity. Regional leaders, and other group members, are eligible to become a Diode Affiliate and participate in revenue-sharing if they introduce and support commercial sales of the Diode products.

## Translation of Diode Collab, Articles, and Announcements

Being able to serve the community in their native language is a great differentiator for Diode. There are a few areas where translation is needed:

- Diode Collab

- Blog Posts and Articles

- Announcements

## Builder community

Diode's grants program is focused on builders who want to use the Diode Network to deploy inherently secure applications.  The apps and solutions builders deploy are a core source of activity Diode Network.

Joining and promoting local hackathons is a great way to show others how Diode can be used.  Even if a regional leader is not themselves technical, the regional leaders should look for more technical group members who can help support builder and hackathon events.
