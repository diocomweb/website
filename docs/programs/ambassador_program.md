# Ambassador Program

**Launching in March, 2024** Monitor the [Diode Telegram channel](https://t.me/diode_chain) or [X](https://x.com/diode_chain) for details.

## Overview

The goal of the Ambassador Program is to promote the use of Diode software and the Diode Network, and the participation in supplying DePIN infrastructure (Relay Nodes) to the Diode Netowrk.

The program registers “Ambassadors” whose will promote Diode in their regions.  Ambassadors can participate in other programs and earn rewards by through their participation, or through the participation of others who they refer.

## Goals

To grow the supply of, and demand for, bandwidth on the Diode Network.  

## Rewards

Every Ambassador will have a reward of 10 DIODE automatically deposited in their Diode identity contract upon registration.

Ambassadors will be eligible for other reward programs, such as the [Bandwidth Growth Program](/docs/programs/bandwidth_growth_program.hmtl), other programs, and other airdrops.

## Registration

In Q1 of 2024, Diode will select a handful of regional Seed Ambassadors who will be the senior ancestors of all other Ambassadors, and who will not need to register with a referral code. Every other Ambassador must register with a referral code from another Ambassador.

In order to register for the program, each would-be Ambassador must sign up on the Diode App, join the "Ambassador Program" Zone (via the invitation code that will be distributed in the Diode Community Telegram channel), and register with the Ambassador Registrar via chat (See ["How to Register"](/docs/programs/ambassador_program.html#how-to-register)).

Upon registering, each Ambassador receives a referral code that they can supply to Relay Nodes or other Ambassadors. Ambassadors can only register by using another Ambassador’s referral code.

### How to Register as an Ambassador

1. Join the Diode Community Telegram channel
2. Download the Diode App and sign up
3. In March of 2024, monitor the Diode Community Telegram channel for an invitation code to the "Ambassador Program" Zone
4. Find an existing Ambassador, ideally in your same geographic region, and ask them for their referral code
5. When the invitation code is posted to the channel, use the code to join the Zone
6. Look for the "Ambassador Registrar" chat and click it
7. Register as an Ambassador by chatting `/register [referral code]` where [referral code] is the actual referral code you got from another Ambassador (e.g. if your parent Ambassador's referral code was `x3jt834`, you'd chat `/register x3jt834`)
8. The chat will return a challenge asking you to confirm you accept the terms of the program
9. If you accept the terms, chat `/register accept-terms`
10. The Ambassador Registrar will then return to you your own referral code - don't lose it!!

## Governance

The Diode Community DAO is responsible for governance of this program.  

All Ambassador registrations are valid for 36 months only, after which the child Ambassador will no longer allocate any rewards to its registered parent. Once a child Ambassador has been registered, registrations may not be changed.
