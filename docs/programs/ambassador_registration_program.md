# Ambassador Registration Program

## Overview

This goal of this program is to grow the number of ambassadors who will promote Diode, and ultimately expand the use of the Diode Network and a more secure Internet.  

The Diode Ambassador's creed is: 1) Secure communications are important 2) Diode is doing great things 3) I will mention Diode to others who may be interested!

## How to Register

[Watch the video for how to sign up](https://www.loom.com/share/1dfa563e4c8440fab78dae982c9445eb)

### Prerequisites
In order to register as a Diode Ambassador, you will first need the following:

1. Download and install the [Diode App](https://diode.io/download#app)
2. Get an Ambassador Referral Code - if you were referred by an existing Ambassor, use the code provided. If you were not referred by an existing Ambassador, select the Referral Code for the country in the “[Regional Codes](https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/ambassador_registration_program.html#regional-codes)” table below.

### Steps
1. Open the Diode app and [join the "Ambassador Program" Zone](https://diode.io/joinzone/#p0xUHtufRS_tMNd9XRvnxbMmXPtOyRbPrQLnLN4j3VNsDhwSrpRYpwbnhMZ2)
2. Wait for the Ambassador Zone to appear and until it is fully initialized (can take a few minutes)
3. Navigate to the Registrar (or "regisrar.diode") chat and initiate a chat with it by sending "hello" (or anything you like)
4. You will be prompted for your referral code - respond with the code you were provided or with a code from the Regional Codes table below
5. You will be asked accept the terms of the program - type "I Accept"
6. You will receive your own Ambassador Program Referral Code
7. You can now use your code to promote the Diode Network to others!
