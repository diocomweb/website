# Ambassador Registration Program

## Overview

Diode Ambassadors promote the use of Diode software and the Diode Network and provide DePIN infrastructure (Relay Nodes) to the Diode Network. The Ambassador Program outlines the benefits and requirements to be a Diode Ambassador. This goal of this program is to grow the number of Ambassadors and ultimately expand the use of the Diode Network and a more secure Internet.  

This page provides details on how to regsiter as an Ambassador. For more information on reward programs, visit Bandwidth Growth Program. 

## How to Register as an Ambassador

### Prerequisites
In order to register as a Diode Ambassador, you will first need the following:

1. Download and install the [Diode App](https://diode.io/download#app)
2. Get an Ambassador Referral Code - if you were referred by an existing Ambassor, use the code provided. If you were not referred by an existing Ambassador, select the Referral Code for the country in the “Regional Codes” table below.

### Steps
1. Open the Diode app and [join the "Ambassador Program" Zone](https://diode.io/joinzone/#I8-h8z8ATSgTXMJdhXwWkQs0VVniODeRgjcBUlmYW78B6qx5I0BCEIdUviie)
2. Wait for the Ambassador Zone to appear and until it is fully initialized (can take a few minutes)
3. Navigate to the Registrar (or "regisrar.diode") chat and initiate a chat with it by sending "hello" (or anything you like)
4. You will be prompted for your referral code - respond with the code you were provided or with a code from the Regional Codes table below
5. You will be asked accept the terms of the program - type "I Accept"
6. You received your own Ambassador Program Referral Code
7. You can now use your code to promote the Diode Network to others!
