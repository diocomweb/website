## Overview

Diode’s vision is to transform the Internet into everyone’s private network. The Diode Foundation’s mission is to disrupt the $7B secure communication market with the Diode Network – an open and permissionless secure communication DePIN.

Where traditional secure communication networks are closed silos, only available in certain regions, and expensive to use, the Diode Network requires no accounts, is available everywhere, and can support the economics of every use case. It delivers secure communication for commodity price of bandwidth.  

The Diode Foundation has issued a limited mint “Disrupt NFT” (8,500 NFTs) for backers of the Diode Network’s disruption trajectory. NFT holders receive a quarterly yield based in proportion to the commercial traction of the project, and can liquidate the NFT for 20 DIODE (following a 3 month holding period).  

## Who is eligible?
Only those residing in regions where the NFT terms are legal may acquire the NFT.  There are limited exemptions available to certain restricted regions - join the [Disrupt NFT zone](https://diode.io/joinzone/#cgzvtSDUSVtPzS2kX18wohdIbBGw8FdRHcbju5MbUnYqZcETIV4YWcEKHPZ2) and contact an Admin for more information.

## How to acquire

For eligible persons, the NFT can be acquired at [https://diodenetwork.io/token](https://diodenetwork.io/token) - look for the “Disrupt NFT” card and follow the steps below.

1. Install Metamask, create, and fund an EVM wallet
  * You will need to have USDC.wh on the Moonbeam network (USDC.wh is USDC wrapped by Wormhole) and Glimmer on the Moonbeam network to buy the NFT(s)
  * If you can get these tokens from an exchange, great - send the amount of USDC.wh you want to spend on NFTs to your EVM wallet, and send 5 Glimmer for gas to the same wallet
  * If you can't already easily get USDC.wh and Glimmer you'll need to swap some from USDC (Ethereum)
    * a) Send USDC (Ethereum) to your wallet for NFT purchase
    * b) Send Ethereum (Ethereum) to your wallet for gas
    * c) Get Glimmer -> use [https://app.stellaswap.com/exchange/cross-chain-swap](https://app.stellaswap.com/exchange/cross-chain-swap) to swap USDC (Ethereum) to Glimmer (Moonbeam)
    * d) Get USDC.wh -> use [https://portalbridge.com/](https://portalbridge.com/) to swap USDC (Ethereum) to USDC (Moonbeam) (called USDC wrapped on that interface)
   
2. Goto [https://diodenetwork.io/token](https://diodenetwork.io/token) and choose how many NFTs you want
  * The card will show you the next available NFT slot number
  * You enter the range of slots you want to buy (e.g. 50 - 60) and it will show you the price
  * In Metamask, select your EVM wallet with the USDC.wh and Glimmer
  * Click "Purchase"
    
3. Accept the transaction in Metamask
  * If you aren't already connected to Metamask, Metamask will pop open and ask to connect (if you are already connected, you will go to the next step right away)
  * If you have sufficient balance for the purchase, Metamask will ask you to confirm the purchase transaction - click "Confirm"
  * After completing that transaction, Metamask will ask you confirm the NFT transfer transaction - click "Confirm"
  * The [https://diodenetwork.io/token](https://diodenetwork.io/token) will show you a Success screen with a link to the transaction information

## Terms

The Disrupt NFT program is a Diode Referral Program and is governed by the [Referral Program Terms](https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/terms.html) and the following embellishments:

### Eligible Holders

Only people who reside in regions where the Disrupt NFT program complies with the relevant restrictions on digital assets in their jurisdiction are eligible to hold this NFT.  If your region has relevant restrictions, please [join the Disrupt NFT zone](https://diode.io/joinzone/#cgzvtSDUSVtPzS2kX18wohdIbBGw8FdRHcbju5MbUnYqZcETIV4YWcEKHPZ2) and chat with an Admin to explore available exemptions.

### Smart Contract Precedence

The Disrupt NFT is issue via an automated smart contract - where these terms differ from the smart contract's functionality, the smart contract takes precedence.

### On Chain Limited Mint

A maximum of 8,500 Disrupt NFTs will be made available from the NFT contract residing on Moonbeam at address , visible on Moonscan at [](). Each NFT is numbered: 1 through 8,500, such number contained in the NFT metadata, the NFT image, and in the NFT contract.

### Pricing
Before the token unlocking date, the NFT can only be purchased for USDC.  After the token unlocking date, the NFT can be purchased for the next numbered NFT price in USDC, or for 20 DIODE tokens.  Each numbered NFT sells for $0.02 more than the previous NFT in USDC, starting at $15 USDC for NFT #1.  For example, NFT #1 will cost $15 USDC, and NFT #8,500 will cost $184.98 USDC. 

### Yield
Per externally held NFT, 0.0065% of the amount of commercial subscription revenues received by Diode, a Wyoming C Corporation, will be allocated by the Diode Foundation to yield for the NFT holders. If all 8,500 NFTs are sold, this will be about 55% of the amount of Diode’s subscription revenues.  A minimum quarterly yield of $2.93 USD (in DIODE tokens, per “Yield Payments” below) will be paid per NFT. Growth in monthly subscriptions above 0% will result in a higher yield.

### Yield Payments
Yield payments will be made in DIODE tokens quarterly to the wallet that owns the NFT. The DIODE token amount will be calculated based on the monthly Diode subscription revenues, in USD, at the quarter-ending DIODE token price, in USD. Any NFT that does not exist at quarter end will not earn yield, even if it existed for part of the period.  

If the Diode Foundation becomes aware that a given holder is not eligible, yield payments may be witheheld from that holder.

### Other Benefits
The Diode Founndation, in its sole discretion, may make other benefits available to eligible Disrupt NFT holders.

### Liquidation
After an initial 90 day holding period, the NFT may be liquidated in exchange for 20 DIODE tokens at any time (upon liquidation, the NFT holder’s wallet will receive 20 DIODE tokens). After liquidation, no more yield will be paid.

### Communications
All official communications related to the Disrupt NFT, including Yield announcements, will be made in the [Disrupt NFT zone](https://diode.io/joinzone/#cgzvtSDUSVtPzS2kX18wohdIbBGw8FdRHcbju5MbUnYqZcETIV4YWcEKHPZ2).

### Term and Termination
The Diode Foundation may elect to pause or stop new NFT sales at any time. The Diode Foundation may terminate the program at any time following March 31, 2026. After program termination, NFTs will not be paid yield, but may be liquidated per these terms.
