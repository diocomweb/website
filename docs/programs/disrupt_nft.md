# Disrupt NFT

## Overview

Diode’s vision is to transform the Internet into everyone’s private network. The Diode Foundation’s mission is to disrupt the $7B secure communication market with the Diode Network – an open and permissionless secure communication DePIN.

Where traditional secure communication networks are closed silos, only available in certain regions, and expensive to use, the Diode Network requires no accounts, is available everywhere, and can support the economics of every use case. It delivers secure communication for commodity price of bandwidth.  

The Diode Foundation has issued a limited mint “Disrupt NFT” (8,500 NFTs) for backers of the Diode Network’s disruption trajectory. NFT holders receive a quarterly yield based in proportion to the commercial traction of the project, and can liquidate the NFT for 20 DIODE (following a 3 month holding period).  

For eligible persons, the NFT can be acquired at https://diodenetwork.io/token

## How to acquire

By going to https://diodenetwork.io/token - look for the “Disrupt NFT” card.

### Who is eligible?
Only those residing in regions where the NFT terms are legal may acquire the NFT.  There are limited exemptions available to accredited investors in the USA - join the [Disrupt NFT zone](https://diode.io/joinzone/#cgzvtSDUSVtPzS2kX18wohdIbBGw8FdRHcbju5MbUnYqZcETIV4YWcEKHPZ2) and contact an Admin for more information.

### Steps to follow
1. Install Metamask, create, and fund an EVM wallet
  * You will need to have USDC.wh on the Moonbeam network (USDC.wh is USDC wrapped by Wormhole) and Glimmer on the Moonbeam network to buy the NFT(s)
  * If you can get these tokens from an exchange, great - send the amount of USDC.wh you want to spend on NFTs to your EVM wallet, and send 5 Glimmer for gas to the same wallet
  * If you can't already easily get USDC.wh and Glimmer you'll need to swap some from USDC (Ethereum)
    * a) Send USDC (Ethereum) to your wallet for NFT purchase
    * b) Send Ethereum (Ethereum) to your wallet for gas
    * c) Get Glimmer -> use https://app.stellaswap.com/exchange/cross-chain-swap to swap USDC (Ethereum) to Glimmer (Moonbeam)
    * d) Get USDC.wh -> use https://portalbridge.com/ to swap USDC (Ethereum) to USDC (Moonbeam) (called USDC wrapped on that interface)
2. Goto https://diodenetwork.io/token and choose how many NFTs you want
  * The card will show you the next available NFT slot number
  * You enter the range of slots you want to buy (e.g. 50 - 60) and it will show you the price
  * In Metamask, select your EVM wallet with the USDC.wh and Glimmer
  * Click "Purchase"
3. Accept the transaction in Metamask
  * If you aren't already connected to Metamask, Metamask will pop open and ask to connect (if you are already connected, you will go to the next step right away)
  * If you have sufficient balance for the purchase, Metamask will ask you to confirm the purchase transaction - click "Confirm"
  * After completing that transaction, Metamask will ask you confirm the NFT transfer transaction - click "Confirm"
  * The https://diodenetwork.io/token will show you a Success screen with a link to the transaction information
