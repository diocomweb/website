# Diode Foundation Affiliate Program

Active! Monitor the [Discord](https://discord.gg/qdGCAKJdHs) channel for details.

## Overview

The Diode Foundation Affiliate Program pays a commission in DIODE tokens to registered Affiliates for Subscriptions to Diode products.  

To participate, simply enroll in the [Diode Foundation Referral Program](https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/ambassador_registration_program.html) and set an Affiliate URL (an article or webpage promoting Diode and referencing your Referral Code).

Some things to note:

* Your Referral Code is your Affiliate Code
* If customers use your Referral Code to sign up for a Diode Collab paid plan, they will get a 10% discount
* You will be paid in DIODE tokens, at their currently listed price, within 10 day of the close of an Epoch (see Epoch information in the banner at [https://diodenetwork.io/](https://diodenetwork.io/app/))
* If you also participate in other Diode Referral Program activites, such as the Bandwidth Growth Program, your status as an Affiliate may unlock additional rewards
* The Diode Foundation Affiliate Program is mutually exclusive with the [Diode Corporation Affiliate Program](https://docs.diode.io/docs/affiliate/affiliate-program/) - if you participate in the corporation's Affiliate Program, you will not also receive DIODE rewards from the Diode Foundation Affiliate Program
* If you are banned from the Diode Referral Program, you will not be eligible for affiliate rewards and your affiliate code will be suspended

## Governance

The Referral Code system is governed by the [Diode Foundation Referral Program](https://diode.foundation/docs/programs/ambassador_registration_program.html).
