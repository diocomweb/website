# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a Seed Referral Code?

A Seed Referral Code is owned by one of the first people who joined the Diode Referrals Program - they received a unique referral code directly from the Diode Foundation and were the "seeds" of referrals in their region. Initially, there was only a single seed code selected per country.  If the seed code over time is not able or not interested in participating in leading growth in their region, another person may be appointed as Diode Community Regional Leader, and their referral code will be the listed regional code for the relevant country. 

## What is a Diode Community Regional Leader?

A Diode Community Regional Leader is the key point person for Diode's ecosystem growth efforts in each country.  Other ecosystem members should work with the country's Diode Community Regional Leader to participate in the programs and for any questions they may have.  Diode Community Regional Leaders can change over time based on the Diode Foundation's discretion.
