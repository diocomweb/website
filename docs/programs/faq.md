# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a Seed Ambassador?

A Seed Ambassador is one of the first Ambassadors who joined Diode's Ambassador Program - they received a unique referral code directly from Diode and were the "seeds" of referrals in their region. Initially, there was only a single Seed Ambassador selected per country.  If the Seed Ambassador over time is not able or not interested in being the Head Ambassador, another Ambassador may be appointed as Head Ambassador for the relevant country. 

## What is a Head Ambassador?

A Head Ambasssador is the key point person for Diode's Ambassador Programs in each country.  Other Ambassadors should work with the country's Head Ambassador to participate in the programs and for any questions they may have.  Initially the Seed Ambassadors are each country's Head Ambassadors, but this can change over time based on the Diode Foundation's discretion.
