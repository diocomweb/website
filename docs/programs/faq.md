# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a Seed Referral Code?

A Seed Referral Code is owned by one of the first people who joined the Diode Referrals Program - they received a unique referral code directly from the Diode Foundation and were the "seeds" of referrals in their region. Initially, there was only a single seed code selected per country.  If the seed code over time is not able or not interested in participating in leading growth in their region, another person may be appointed as Diode Community Regional Leader, and their referral code will be the listed regional code for the relevant country. 

## What is a Diode Community Regional Leader?

A Diode Community Regional Leader is the key point person for Diode's ecosystem growth efforts in each country.  Other ecosystem members should work with the country's Diode Community Regional Leader to participate in the programs and for any questions they may have.  Diode Community Regional Leaders can change over time based on the Diode Foundation's discretion.

## What are epochs?

An epoch is a **30 day** period to track user activity, and rewards are calculated and distributed based on the activity within the epoch.

## What does "staking your node" mean?

There is a **10-day staking window** after the start of each epoch. Nodes need at least **1 $DIODE staked** to qualify for rewards, and **10 $DIODE** for full points.

## How are Zone points calculated?

These are calculated on **active daily users**, not just invites or registrations. Sending unsolicited invites is considered to be spam and your Zone will be banned from earning points that epoch if this happens.

## Does my node placement matter?

New or under-served regions earn extra points for bringing the network closer to users while nodes clustered in the same datacenter/IP range compete and may earn less.

## How do I register for points?
Join the Diode Foundation Referral program, join the Diode Referrals Zone in Diode Collab, and register your Zone, node, or wallet with the Registrar chat bot.
