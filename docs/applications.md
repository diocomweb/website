# Apps and Projects

Many projects leverage the Diode Network as their secure communications backbone.  By doing this, they can eliminate MITM attacks that plague traditional PKI-based communications, be inherently end-to-end encrypted, and take advantage of the many additional features of the Diode Network.

Check out the [Diode Network docs site](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/project/apps-and-projects/) for a list of Apps and Projects and more information!
