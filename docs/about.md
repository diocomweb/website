# About


The Diode Foundation was created in 2020 to deploy and sustain worldwide secure Internet communications via the [Diode Network](/docs/diode_network.html).

We operate via the guidance of the [Diode Community DAO](/docs/dao.html).

Although we collaborate closely with Diode, we are not otherwise owned or controlled by Diode.  We are an ownerless Panama Private Interest Foundation whose charter requires us to operate consistently with our purpose.
