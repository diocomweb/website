# Diode Community DAO


The Diode Community DAO is comprised of members from around the world who propose programs and vote on the proposals.  The foundation operates on the basis of the [approved programs](/docs/programs.html).

We will be making the Diode Community DAO membership open to certain engaged [Ambassadors](/docs/programs/ambassador_registration_program.html) in 2024.

The Diode Community DAO uses Snapshot for [Diode Community DAO proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/diodefoundation.eth) and voting.
